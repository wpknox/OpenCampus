# OpenCampus

## Information
This project was created for my COM S 309 class in the fall of 2019. We made an Android app written in Java that was a map of our university's campus. In the app, users can create and post different areas of around campus that they can share with other users. The users can interact with each other by leaving reviews and ratings on someone else's posted location or "USpot".

To create this app, we used **Android Studio** for the Frontend and **Spring Boot** for the Backend. We used the **Google Maps API** for our map. To save information, we used a **MySQL server and JPA** to access the server from the Backend code.

Morgan Smith, Axel Zumwalt, and Brett Santema were the Frontend developers for this project. I wrote the Backend code that handled all HTTP Requests and processed transactions to the MySQL Server. Before this project, I did not have any experience with HTTP Requests, Spring, or SQL. Having this project really helped develop my skills as a software engineer and taught me to think outside the box and how to approach problems that I had not seen before.

Any file with the **@author Willis Knox** tag was written by me. Basically, that is every file on the Backend except a couple of test classes that Axel Zumwalt wrote.

Below is a basic description of our app when we first designed it and the Postman collection I used to test the Backend.

### Description
A better map of Iowa State University campus that shows more in depth features like water fountains, bathrooms, bike racks, classroom numbers, study spots, or other features 
that are useful to students and visitors on campus. Different time sensitive additions could include events or construction that will stay on the map for a specific duration.
We can include user input to rank things like study spots and give feedback to other users. We will implement a fastest route option that takes into
account walking between two different locations on the map. These routes will be tied to a specific user and they will be able to view their saved routes on the app.
Different features can be filtered based on userâ€™s needs. For example: male, female, or unisex bathrooms.

### Postman Link
Click this link to access all of Willis's current requests he has made in Postman to test the backend:

[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/10c95a13853d4c832aa0)

If you have Postman on your computer, it should open up an exact copy of the *Collection* in Postman.

If you don't have Postman, don't worry, this should direct you to download it on your computer. Then you will be able to run the *Requests*.
