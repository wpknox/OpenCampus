# COM S 309 SS_4 Repo

## Project Name: OpenCampus

### Description
A better map of Iowa State University campus that shows more in depth features like water fountains, bathrooms, bike racks, classroom numbers, study spots, or other features 
that are useful to students and visitors on campus. Different time sensitive additions could include events or construction that will stay on the map for a specific duration.
We can include user input to rank things like study spots and give feedback to other users. We will implement a fastest route option that takes into
account walking between two different locations on the map. These routes will be tied to a specific user and they will be able to view their saved routes on the app.
Different features can be filtered based on userâ€™s needs. For example: male, female, or unisex bathrooms.
More features can be added on to this application as requested.

### Postman Link
Click this link to access all of Willis's current requests he has made in Postman to test the backend:

[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/10c95a13853d4c832aa0)


If you have Postman on your computer, it should open up an exact copy of the *Collection* in Postman.

If you don't have Postman, don't worry, this should direct you to download it on your computer. Then you will be able to run the *Requests*.

Sadly, this will not update dynamically, so Willis will have to be updating this link frequently when he makes new *Requests*.
