I used the following link as a base to set up this Spring Boot application.
<https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/>

Instead of making a Greeter I decided to make an extremely basic User class.
If the server is running, you view the JSON by typing "http://http://localhost:8080/welcome"
into the URL.
